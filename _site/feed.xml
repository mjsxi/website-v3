During this project I was involved primarily with refining the homepage and interacting with both the design and code to focus on clarity of information, good design, and clean code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my main focus was on the homepage redesign and various problem sloving involved with it I also touched a bunch of smaller things like storystreams and various interactions across the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main challenges of the project was to establish design patterns that would work across all types of campaigns, while pulling out the most relevant pieces of the data story. We used a blend of data visualization and natural language summaries to achive this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
