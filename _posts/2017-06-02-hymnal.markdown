This is for carrie blah blah blah For the better part of last year, I worked on the product design and development of Vox Media's proprietary custom display and native ad unit publishing platform, Hymnal.

I worked on a small but mighty team on creating the best user experience possible on a platform that's a workhorse for the company's bottom line. I've had the pleasure of conducting several product design sprints with the team, guiding/contributing to everything from wireframes to sketching to prototyping to ultimately testing the platform on users.
